  * Change vignette data location to comply to R 3.0 requirements
  
  * Add NAMESPACE
  
  * Minor modification to accommodate upgrade in neldermead packages
  
  * Added protection of parameter variables so they cannot be modified in 
    $DERIVED
  
  * Deprecated functions: zzz.R

  * Switch from dde function (PBSddesolve package) to dede function (deSolve
  package) to integrate of delayed differential equations. Dependency to 
  
  * Change in input arguments to scarabee.new due to the switch in the dede
  solver.
  
  * Bug fixes in making.dosing.R, ode.model.R, and dde.model.R to correct 
  problem with dosing history.
  
  * Deprecated functions: dde.map, dde.switch, and get.switch.vector.

  * Windows-specific bugs in demos have been corrected
  
  * Vignette updated to document the demos.

  * scaRabee gets a major overhaul with version 1.1. Changes affect almost every
  provided functionalities. 
    * scaRabee now reads (only) datasets specified using NONMEM or S-ADPAT 
    standards. Dosing and covariates files are no longer required and multiple 
    functions have been modified accordingly.
    * scaRabee model is now specified in a single txt file, which uses a 
    tag-based syntax, very much like the one used in NM-TRAN control streams, 
    S-ADAPT-TRAN models, or MONOLIX models. Residual variability and secondary
    parameters are also specified in the same file.
    * scaRabee now can perform population analysis using the standard two stage 
    method.
    * scaRabee now can perform direct grid search.
  
  * There is no backward compatibility with versions 1.0.
  
  * Almost all existing functions were modified as a result of these changes. 
  New functions are distributed with version 1.1.
  
  * init.report was given a new name initialize.report
  
  * Deprecated functions: find.id.R and weigthing.additive

  * scarabee.analysis: corrected data file reading issues when observations are
  provided for more than one system states.

  * estimation.plot and simulation.plot: move the par(ask=TRUE) call

  * find.id: modify code to allow user to specify its own

  * DESCRIPTION: added missing dependencies to deSolve and PBSddesolve packages
  
  * scarabee.directory: corrected permission problems in Windows environment
  in all file.copy calls.

  * scaRabee.Rnw: corrected \bibliography{scaRabee.bib} to
    \bibliography{scaRabee} to address compilation issue in Windows.
