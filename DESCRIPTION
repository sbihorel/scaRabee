Description: scaRabee is a port of the Scarabee toolkit originally
        written as a Matlab-based application. It provides a framework
        for simulation and optimization of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
        models at the individual and population level. It is built on top of the
        neldermead package, which provides the direct search algorithm proposed 
        by Nelder and Mead for model optimization.
Depends: neldermead (>= 1.0-8), optimsimplex (>= 1.0-5), optimbase (>= 1.0-8), lattice, grid, deSolve, utils
