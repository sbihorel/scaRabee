Description: scaRabee is a port of the Scarabee toolkit originally written as a 
  Matlab-based application. It provides a framework for simulation and optimization 
  of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models at the individual and population level.
  It is built on top of the neldermead package, which provides the direct search 
  algorithm proposed by Nelder and Mead for model optimization.
